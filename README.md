The following notebook is an analysis and construction of two ML models that predict whether a Near Earth Object should be considered 'hazardous.' I started this project out of my own curiosity, and for fun, wanting to learn more about using machine learning. Because the dataset was imbalanced (only about 10% of NEO are considered hazardous), I used oversampling to re-balance the dataset. I also tweaked the decision threshold of the random forest model to achieve a better False Negative ratio. Ultimately, the random forest model out performed the Gradient Boosted Tree with an accuracy of about 92.4% There is still a high ratio of False Negatives, but improving this further would also increase the number of False Positives.
